FINAL PROJECT

Step 1. Preparing a file to import
I want to import the first book that I wrote and analyze it in various ways, especially in comparison to some of my favorite authors. The first step is to prepare the file. It's a .doc, so I want to make it into a .txt first. I also need to eliminate some formatting and get rid of all the accented letters (there are a lot) to make it easier for the computer to read.
