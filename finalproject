FINAL PROJECT

Step 1. Preparing a file to import
I want to import the first book that I wrote and analyze it in various ways, especially in comparison to some of my favorite authors. The first step is to prepare the file. It's a .doc, so I want to make it into a .txt first. I also need to eliminate some formatting and get rid of all the accented letters (there are a lot) to make it easier for the computer to read.
After preparing my .txt file, I looked at gutenbergr to look at the format of the books in that library.

Next, I tried to put a bit of my own text into a tibble. I found, after some errors, that they best way for me to input the data is to put quotes around every line.
